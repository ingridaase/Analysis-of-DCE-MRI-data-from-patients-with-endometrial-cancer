# Master's thesis repository
This repository includes the code for the master's thesis "Analysis of DCE-MRI data from patients with endometrial cancer". In this project the pharmacokinetic model extended Tofts' method (ETM) was used to analyse DCE-MRI data from patients with endometrial cancer for quantitative perfusion parameters. Most of the algorithms used for running ETM on DCE-MRI data are included in this repository. Two images are required for running ETM, including whole-volume tumor masks and the DCE-MRI images. In addition, an arterial input function is required. Examples of how the resulting parameters were analysed and visualized are also included in this repository.
